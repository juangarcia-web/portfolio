// Given a list of clock times,
// find the pair which has the smallest duration between them.

// For instance, if given 07:42, 03:03, 02:15, and 10:23,
// the smallest duration is 48 minutes between the pair 02:15 and 03:03.
// Your code should print the number of minutes between the times,
// as well as the two times in any order.

// [ "17:21", "23:50", "04:01", "07:07", "03:03", "00:01", "12:42", "16:03"];
